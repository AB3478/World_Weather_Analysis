## Challenge Overview

### PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company that specializes in internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry. The company has requested: 
-	Adding the weather description to the weather data collected
-	Filtering the data based on beta testersâ€™ weather preferences, which will then be used to identify potential travel destinations.
-	From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary, which will include a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map


## Challenge Summary
## Part 1 - Retrieve Weather Data
To create a new DataFrame containing updated weather data, I first generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieved the nearest city, and performed an API call with OpenWeatherMap. The API call retrieved:
 - Latitude and longitude
 - Maximum temperature
 - Percent humidity
 - Wind speed
 - Weather description

## Part 2 - Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
I added input from beta tester's regarding their weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The following map highlights those destinations and includes a layer map with pop-up markers including additional city and hotel-related details.

## Part 3 - Create a Travel Itinerary Map
Beta testers chose four cities from the vacation map that other customers might want to visit, including Sanary-Sur-Mer, France, Mantua, Florence, and Sestri Levante, Italy. To map this Mediterranean vacation, a directions layer map was created with a starting and ending city.

The marker layer map was updated to provide potential customers with additional details for the four cities included on the Mediterranean vacation itinerary.
